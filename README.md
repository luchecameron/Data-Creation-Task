# ðŸ§¾ Harmony Electronics â€“ Sales Data Simulation

Tasked with simulating sales data for a retail store of my choice. I will generate a .csv dataset of at least 200â€“250 transactions. Each row should represent a single sales transaction.This project generates a synthetic sales dataset for Harmony Electronics using Python, Pandas, and NumPy. It simulates realistic retail transactions for data analysis and visualization practice.

## ðŸ”§ Overview

Created 250 transactions with:

Unique transaction & customer IDs

Customer age groups

Product categories, product names, and prices

Purchase dates (Jan 2024 â€“ Jan 2025)

Payment methods

Calculated Total Sale Amount (R) for each transaction.

Exported the dataset as my_dataset.csv to keep results consistent.

## ðŸ“Š Visualization

Grouped data by month to calculate total revenue.

Plotted monthly revenue using Matplotlib (purple line graph).

## ðŸ§° Tools Used
